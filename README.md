# 3D-Snake-Game
This is a 3D version of the classic Snake game, built entirely in Python using OpenGL. It features both first-person and third-person views, animated graphics, bombs, special food, and changing difficulty levels. It's a fun way to explore graphics programming while keeping the spirit of the original game alive.
